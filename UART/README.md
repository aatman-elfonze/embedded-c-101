# UART

UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter, which is a hardware communication interface commonly used in embedded systems and microcontrollers.

UART is a simple and popular serial communication protocol that enables two devices to communicate with each other over a serial connection. It allows for the transmission of data between devices at a specific baud rate, which determines the speed of data transfer.

UART operates in an asynchronous mode, meaning that data is transmitted one bit at a time without the use of a clock signal. This makes UART less complex and more reliable than other synchronous communication protocols such as SPI and I2C.

The UART interface consists of two pins: the transmit pin (TX) and the receive pin (RX). The TX pin sends data from the transmitting device, while the RX pin receives data at the receiving end. The data is transmitted in a specific format that includes a start bit, data bits, parity bit, and stop bit.

UART is widely used in a variety of applications, such as communication between microcontrollers, communication with peripheral devices, and serial communication with PCs. It is a simple and effective way to transmit data over a serial connection, making it a popular choice in embedded systems and electronics projects.

# Explanation of the program

This program is meant to be run on a microcontroller-based system. It initializes the UART0 communication interface of the microcontroller and implements functions to transmit and receive data over this interface.

The program first defines some macros to set various configuration options for the UART0 interface. It then defines three functions: uart_init(), uart_TxChar(), and uart_RxChar().

The uart_init() function sets up the UART0 interface with a specified baud rate, 8-bit data, 1 stop bit, and no parity. It also calculates the necessary divisor for the UART clock based on the system clock frequency.

The uart_TxChar() function transmits a single character over the UART0 interface. It waits for the previous transmission to complete before sending the new character.

The uart_RxChar() function receives a single character over the UART0 interface. It waits until data is available in the receive buffer before reading the received character.

The main() function of the program initializes the system clock and the UART0 interface with a baud rate of 9600. It then transmits a predefined string "Hello World" over the UART0 interface using the uart_TxChar() function.

Finally, the main() function enters an infinite loop in which it receives a single character from the UART0 interface using the uart_RxChar() function and then transmits it back using the uart_TxChar() function. This loop repeats indefinitely, allowing for bidirectional communication over the UART0 interface.
